Overall IDEA of Prject:

In this sales prediction project, various advertising channels such as TV, newspaper, etc., were analyzed. Initially, statistical analysis was performed on the dataset to understand its characteristics. As the data exhibited a wide range of differences across columns, mathematical log transformations were applied to all input features. Subsequently, the data was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Several machine learning models were employed for sales prediction, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized in conjunction with Linear Regression to explore the data's underlying structure and improve predictive accuracy.

The performance of each model was assessed using metrics such as root mean squared error, mean squared error, and R-squared. Visualizations, including QQ plots and bar plots, were employed to further analyze the distribution of the sales data and compare actual sales with predicted values generated by the machine learning models.

Stpes:
	1)Find Statistics
